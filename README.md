# Hangman-Game
An exercise to create a Hangman game using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Game
It's Hangman—with an Oregon Trail twist. You're a pioneer traversing America on a journey to Oregon. Guess the letters correctly and you continue on your way. Guess incorrectly and your family members sadly suffer from 1800s-era maladies.

Can you survive your Oregon Adventure?
